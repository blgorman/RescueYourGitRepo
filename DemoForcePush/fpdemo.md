# Getting Started

To get started, Fork this repo at GitHub or clone to your local and push to your own repo at GitHub
this will ensure you have a repo that you have full control over to see the results of walking through this demo

## Create your `dev/feature` branch

First, you must create a branch at remote and pull it locally, or create a branch locally and push it.  Whether or not you are using trunk-based or some sort of GitFlow, just set your branch schema so that you can simulate other developers moving the trunk or dev branch forward.  For simplicity, this demo just utilizes `main` and your own branch.

1. Create a new `feature` branch as a developer

1. Ensure that you can push changes to it from your local development machine

## Create a few changes

Ensure that you make a couple of small commits and that you have some history on your branch both locally and at the remote.

1. Create a new file called `mychanges.txt` or something similar

1. Commit and push the changes

1. Add additional changes to the file, then commit and push.

## Create a change on `main`
